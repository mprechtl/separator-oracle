# Separator Oracle - mkosi Image

Within this directory you can run `mkosi` to create an VM image which can be used for Insekta. This VM image contains the vulnerable separator oracle which runs on port 8105. At the end of the mkosi generation the session id and secret key id are printed. This session id simulates an active user and you have to obtain the username and the password from it! Enjoy it! ;)
