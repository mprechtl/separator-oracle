    A separator oracle can be used to decrypt a ciphertext which was encrypted with AES in CTR mode. The separator oracle attack
    is an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack. An attacker sends modified ciphertexts to the oracle. A separator is a special
    character like ';' or '|'. In our case ';' is used. The separator oracle throws a 'SeparatorException', if not the right
    amount of separators within the ciphertext/plaintext is used.

<p>
    In our case an auto-login cookie is used. This cookie has a 'session_id' and a 'secret_key_id'. There is already an user
    active with the Cookie: 'session_id=9gg7PZyI907p2udNpr/aTPjXdEbbpQ==; secret_key_id=HbgMmA3Tum7xW5N6SdpsaWli4AGx83Z7QXIRG6ALrbc='.
    You already highjacked this session and now you want to determine the username and password. For this purpose, you can
    use the separator oracle, accessible throug the IP-address of the virtual machine with port 8105!

<h3>Tasks</h3>

{% call task(identifier='username', type='question') %}
<p>Username within the highjacked session id of a user?</p>
{{ answer(expected='??????') }}
{% endcall %}

{% call task(identifier='password', type='question') %}
<p>Password within the highjacked session id of a user?</p>
{{ answer(expected='?????') }}
{% endcall %}

<p>
    ps: There is also another security issue in the separator oracle, maybe you find it. ;)
